## Reveal.js

[Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) is a powerful tool to build slides on web using `HTML` or `Markdown`. To use it locally is very easy, just download the source code on github and open `demo.html` you can see the result in your browser. Using it on web page is almost the same, put `reveal.js` in `/assets/reveal.js` and modify the path in `demo.html` to the folder in `assets`, then everything works.   
`Reveal.js` has natural support of [`Markdown`](https://revealjs.com/markdown/), which makes it possible for us to integrate it into our `jekyll` based web page.

## Online Solutions

There are already some solutions to integrate `reveal.js` in `jekyll`, like [jekyll-revealjs](https://github.com/dploeger/jekyll-revealjs), [reveal-jekyll](https://github.com/tasmo/reveal-jekyll). Most of them use costum plugins to porcess raw `html` files generated by `jekyll` to `reveal.js`'s style, this can cause several confusions:

* many previous solutions require you to write every slide in seperate file
* `jekyll` defaultly generates `html` file for every post using its own parser, this may cause images, math equations and codes incompatible with `reveal.js`
* for the same reason, it's also inconvinent to directly put `md` code into `html` letting `reveal.js` to process markdown using `marked`

Spending a lot of time sereaching and testing, I decided to turn to offline solutions.

## Pandoc!

[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is extremely useful to convert files from one format into another, not surprisingly it supports `reveal.js`:
```bash
pandoc -t revealjs -s -o myslides.html myslides.md -V revealjs-url=https://unpkg.com/reveal.js@3.9.2/
```

`revealjs-url` can be local directory like `/assets/reveal.js`, you can also use other command to specify styles and templates. 

## Set Up Pipeline

The first thing to do is to find a place to store markdown files and generated html files. I set up two directories `_slides` and `_slides-md` under home directory, then I can create a `ruby` script to generate those slides:
```ruby

```
